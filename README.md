# Face Insight AI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project

Face Insight AI is a web application that allows users to upload images and detect facial features using Azure Face API. With this app, users can detect and recognize faces, analyze facial attributes like age, gender, and emotions, and identify faces in a group photo.

## How it works

To use Face Insight AI, simply upload an image containing a face, and the app will use Azure Face API to analyze the image and detect facial features. Once the analysis is complete, you can view the results and see details about the detected features.
